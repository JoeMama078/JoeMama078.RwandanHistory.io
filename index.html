                <h2><b><u>Tutsi Monarchy</u></b></h2>
                <p>Before colonization, Rwanda had 3 major ethnic groups, <b>Hutu</b>(4/5 of the population), <b>Tutsi</b>(1/7 of the population), <b>Twa</b>(1% of the population). Even though the Tutsis showed up after the Hutus, they brought cattle with them, which played a major role in increasing their social class throughout the years. Eventually, Tutsis became the top in the social class and so many were kings and seen as elite. Even though power between the Tutsis and everyone else was distributed unfairly, no one complained, and they all worked in a symbiotic relationship. Additionally, pretty much everyone in the country spoke Kinyarwanda.

            Before the missionaries of the Order of the White Fathers brought Christianity in 1905, Rwanda had a traditional monotheistic religion. They worshiped one god referred to as Imana and also worshiped a great personality Ryangombe, who was the representation of god on earth.

            <ul style="background-color: rgb(72, 186, 148);" class="Rounded">
            <h2><b><u>What Happened?</u></b></h2>
            Extremist Hutus(about 200,000) killed any civilians(about 800,000) who were a part of the Tutsi population and also killed anyone who opposed their genocidal plan. This Genocide occured on April 1994 - July 1994.
            </ul>
            <ul style="background-color: rgb(72, 186, 148);" class="Rounded">
                <h2><b><u>Why?</u></b></h2>
                Due to Rwanda being a great place for cheap labor and natural resources that were very much needed during the industrial revolution in Europe, colonization was eminent. Germany first colonized Rwanda in 1899 because they were assigned Rwanda in the Berlin Conference in 1884. After German loss in WWI, the country became a mandate territory under the League of Nations under the Belgians. The Belgian colonizers arrived in 1919 and would later divide the Tutsis and the Hutus based on their appearances, and their social status. Physically, Tutsis were described as tall with thin noses, while Hutus were desribed as short and flat nosed. Some Europeans even referred to Tutsis as "false negross" meaning Europeansss with black skin. Additionally, people who were richer were also identified as a Tutsi. Ex: People with 10 of more cattle were considered Tutsi. By 1959, the colonial Belgium and all other colonial powers withdrawn, but the racial damage had already been done.

            <ul style="background-color: rgb(72, 186, 148);" class="Rounded">
                <h2><b><u>Scramble for Power</u></b></h2>
                Many Hutus held hatred towards the Tutsis because of how much better they were treated by the Europeans. They believed that they should have all the political power since they were the majority. Hutus now filled with rage, revolted against the Tutsis and drove most of them out of the country. Rwanda now transitioned to an independent republic with a new Hutu government. 
            </ul>
            <ul style="background-color: rgb(72, 186, 148);" class="Rounded">
                <h2><b><u>The Returning of the Tutsis</u></b></h2>
                In 1979, exiled Tutsis created the Rwandan Alliance for National Unity (RANU). The goals of the RANU were to return the Tutsi population to Rwanda and remove divisive identity politics(politics based on race, gender, ethnicity) from the past. RANU members in Uganda overthrew their government. Yoweri Museveni was the leader of the overthrow and later became the president of Uganda. With war experience in Uganda under their belts, the RANU members were now ready to bring revolution in Rwanda. The RANU was reorganized as two wings. The first being the RPF and the RPA. The RPF was the Rwandan Patriotic Front and the RPA was the Rwandan Patriotic Army. There were some peace talks held between the RPF and the Rwandan government, but most weren’t successful. Since 1988, the RPF has been led by Paul Kagame, the current president of Rwanda.

                The RPF launched an invasion and invaded Rwanda in 1990 beginning a civil war. The war lasted 3 years before it was finally resolved with a peace accord.

                Created in December 1990 by the Hutu Power political movement, the commandments detailed strict rules which decided who was a Tutsi or not. It really was just propaganda by extremist Hutus who wanted to spread anti-Tutsi ideas in order to promote the Genocide.

                From July 8, 1993 - July 1, 1994, a Rwandan Radio station named, Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines derived from the description of Rwanda: "Land of a Thousand Hills", aired racial propaganda created by extremist Hutus. This radio station was widely regarded as creating a hostile atmosphere in Rwanda.
                <br>
                <b>Excerpts from some RTLM broadcasts</b>
                <br>
                1. “You will see RPF children who, in daytime, make themselves street children but who, in the night, disguise themselves and go to inform the RPF on the situation.”
                <br>
                2. “I think that those who have guns should immediately go to these Inkotanyi(meant "All the Tutsis" or the enemy) before they listen to Radio RTLM and flee. Stand near this place and encircle them and kill them because they are there.”
            </ul>

                <h2><b><u>The Breaking Point</u></b></h2>
                Juvénal Habyarimana was the Hutu president of Rwanda for 20 years but tragically died in a returning plan crash with the Hutu president of Burundi in 1994. This led to many Hutus speculating that the Tutsis planned the killing of their president. Now, with high tensions between the Hutus and the Tutsis, the Genocide began. The Genocide finally ended when the Tutsi army from the previous civil war, seized control of the country.

            <p>Gacaca(meaning “Justice on the grass”) courts were Traditional Rwandian courts used for resolving interpersonal conflicts. These courts had to be used to convict the some 120,000 Rwandians after the genocide because it was way faster than convicting them in formal courts. Gacaca(pronounced Ga-Cha-Cha) courts had appointed judges. Local witnesses presented testimony for/against the accused. Then the judges would determine an appropriate penalty. These trials did not have any professional attorneys or judges and the evidence was just spoken word.</p>
